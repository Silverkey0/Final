# Final Project Outline
## Title
Differential Gene Expression in TCGA within Stage ? ? comparing ? and ? using DeSEQ2.
## Author
Henry Xu
## Overview of Project
I will identify differentially expressed genes between ?. This analysis will utilize the package DeSEQ2 and follow the specific vignette: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html. For this analysis, I'll use the TCGA cohort and have identified ? ht-seq counts files for tumors that fit within my cohort with ? and ?. Within the analysis, I will control for race and ethnicity.

Vignette: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html
## Data
I will use the data from https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository. Examining clinical data, there are ? tumor samples, and ? are defined by me as ? and ? are identified as ?. The specific files are available are here [redacted].
## Milestone 1
**Due Date**: Thursday November 22th
**Data fully loaded into vignette through htseq steps.** I will complete an entire first draft of analysis analyzed through the vignette.
## Milestone 2
**Due Date**: Thursday November 29th
**An initial completion of vignette.** I will complete an entire first draft of analysis analyzed through the vignette.Data loaded into vignette (through htseq), for seeking feedback. Not all sections in the writing will be completed, but will be final project.
## Deliverable
**Due Date**: December 3rd
A complete repository with clear documentation and description of your analysis and results.
