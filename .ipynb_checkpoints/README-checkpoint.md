# Final Project Outline
## Title
Differential Gene Expression in TCGA-PAAD within Stage II pancrease ductal and lobular neoplasms comparing drinkers and non-drinkers using DeSEQ2.
## Author
Henry Xu
## Overview of Project
I will identify differentially expressed genes for pancrease ductal and lobular neoplasms between drinkers and non-drinkers. This analysis will utilize the package DeSEQ2 and follow the specific vignette: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html. For this analysis, I'll use the TCGA cohort and have identified 35 STAR-Counts files for tumors that fit within my cohort with 25 drinkers and 10 non-drinkers. Within the analysis, I will control for race (white), gender (male), ethnicity (not hispanic or latino).

## Data
I will use the data from https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository. Examining clinical data, there are 35 tumor samples, and 25 are defined by me as drinkers, and 10 are identified as non-drinkers. The specific files are available are here https://github.com/Silverkey0/Final/tree/main/pancrease_clinical.cases
## Milestone 1
**Due Date**: Thursday November 22th
**Data fully loaded into vignette through DeSEQ2 steps.** I will complete an entire first draft of analysis analyzed through the vignette.
## Milestone 2
**Due Date**: Thursday November 29th
**An initial completion of vignette.** I will do further analysis through the vignette.Data loaded into vignette (through STAR), for seeking feedback. Not all sections in the writing will be completed, but will be final project.
## Deliverable
**Due Date**: December 3rd
A complete repository with clear documentation and description of your analysis and results.
